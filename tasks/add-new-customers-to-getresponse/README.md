# Add new customers to GetResponse

* [Task script](./script.liquid)

Does what it says on the tin. :) Provide your GetResponse API key (found under the account menu, under "Integrations & API" and "API") and a list token (found in the settings for your list â€“ look for 5-6 letters and numbers), and Mechanic will automatically send each new customer account (full name and email address) over to GetResponse.
