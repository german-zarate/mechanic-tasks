Useful for enforcing order limits on the backend, use this task to ensure that too many of a certain product cannot be purchased. This task can be configured with multiple SKUs, too!

Notes:

* SKUs are case-sensitive!
* The total quantity will be calculated by adding the quantities from each line item in the order, having a SKU that matches the SKU(s) you provide.
* Any refunds generated by this task will be for the maximum amount, for the order being cancelled.
